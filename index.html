        <h2>The Formation of System Of A Down</h2>
        <p>
          <spam class="bold">Serj Tankian and Daron Malakian</spam> attended
          Rose and Alex Pilibos Armenian School as children. Due to their
          eight-year age difference, they did not meet until 1992 while working
          on separate projects at the same recording studio. They formed a band
          named Soil with Tankian on vocals and keyboards, Malakian on vocals
          and guitar, Dave Hakopyan on bass and Domingo "Dingo" Laranio on
          drums.
        </p>
        <p>
          The band hired <spam class="bold">Shavo Odadjian</spam> as manager,
          although he eventually joined Soil on second guitar.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1994, after only one live show and one jam session recording,
          Hakopyan and Laranio left the band.
        </p>
        <p>
          After Soil split up, Tankian, Odadjian, and Malakian formed a new
          band, <spam class="bold">System of a Down</spam>. The group took its
          name from a poem that Malakian had written titled "Victims of a Down".
          The word "victims" was changed to "system" because Odadjian believed
          that it would appeal to a much wider audience and also because the
          group wanted their records to be alphabetically shelved closer to
          their musical heroes, Slayer. Odadjian switched from guitar to bass
          and passed on his managerial duties to Velvet Hammer Music and
          Management Group and its founder David "Beno" Benveniste. The band
          recruited drummer Ontronik "Andy" Khachaturian, an old school friend
          of Malakian and Odadjian who had played with Malakian in a band called
          Snowblind during their teens.
        </p>
        <p>
          In mid-1997, drummer Khachaturian left the band because of a hand
          injury. Khachaturian was replaced by
          <spam class="bold">John Dolmayan</spam>.

        <h2>SOAD Curiosities:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The band originally had “Suicide” as the title of “Chop Suey!”. In
            fact, the words “We’re rolling suicide” can be heard in the song’s
            opening seconds on select pressings of the album.
          </li>
          <li>
            The band’s first official release of a professionally recorded song
            was on a collection called Hye Enk (“we’re Armenian” in English), an
            Armenian Genocide recognition compilation, in 1997.
          </li>
          <li>
            System of a Down appeared on South Park‘s ‘Chef Aid’ album in 1998.
            The band provided the music for the song “Will They Die 4 You?”.
          </li>
          <li>
            The song “Mind,” from their self-titled debut album, remains the
            longest song System of a Down officially released in the studio,
            clocking in at six minutes and 15 seconds.
          </li>
          <li>
            The song “ATWA” has a link to Charles Manson. The acronym stands for
            “Air, Trees, Water, Animals” or “All the Way Alive,” and was used by
            Charles Manson and his associates as a term to promote the unity of
            life on Earth through nature.
          </li>
          <li>
            The band has been nominated for 4 Grammy Awards over the years. They
            won the award in 2006 for Best Hard Rock Performance for the song
            “B.Y.O.B.”.
