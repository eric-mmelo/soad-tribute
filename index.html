        <h2>The Formation of System Of A Down</h2>
        <p>
          <spam class="bold">Serj Tankian and Daron Malakian</spam> attended
          Rose and Alex Pilibos Armenian School as children. Due to their
          eight-year age difference, they did not meet until 1992 while working
          on separate projects at the same recording studio. They formed a band
          named Soil with Tankian on vocals and keyboards, Malakian on vocals
          and guitar, Dave Hakopyan on bass and Domingo "Dingo" Laranio on
          drums.
        </p>
        <p>
          The band hired <spam class="bold">Shavo Odadjian</spam> as manager,
          although he eventually joined Soil on second guitar.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1994, after only one live show and one jam session recording,
          Hakopyan and Laranio left the band.
        </p>
        <p>
          After Soil split up, Tankian, Odadjian, and Malakian formed a new
          band, <spam class="bold">System of a Down</spam>. The group took its
          name from a poem that Malakian had written titled "Victims of a Down".
          The word "victims" was changed to "system" because Odadjian believed
          that it would appeal to a much wider audience and also because the
          group wanted their records to be alphabetically shelved closer to
          their musical heroes, Slayer. Odadjian switched from guitar to bass
          and passed on his managerial duties to Velvet Hammer Music and
          Management Group and its founder David "Beno" Benveniste. The band
          recruited drummer Ontronik "Andy" Khachaturian, an old school friend
          of Malakian and Odadjian who had played with Malakian in a band called
          Snowblind during their teens.
        </p>
        <p>
          In mid-1997, drummer Khachaturian left the band because of a hand
          injury. Khachaturian was replaced by
          <spam class="bold">John Dolmayan</spam>.
